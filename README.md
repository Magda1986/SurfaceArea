# SurfaceArea


The program is used to calculate the surface area of a figure described in the XY coordinate system.
An analytical method of determining the field based on Gauss formulas was used.

Calculation of area based on trapezoids with bases parallel to the X axis and trapezoids with bases parallel to the Y axis.

Define the location of the X Y points in the list.

An additional advantage is the generation of a defined figure on the coordinate system.
